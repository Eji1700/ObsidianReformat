# ObsidianReformat

Got into Obsidian a year or two ago to try and consolidate tracking Movies/Shows/Books/Resturants/etc.  Things to watch or thoughts about them. Like many I didn't really get it right the first time.  So here I am writing some UGLY F# to go through the MASSIVE tables i've made and create a proper note for each entry.

I'm hoping to use this to get some of the rust off my skills and as something to better focus on proper idiomatic code with. I may not go full Type based build up, but i'd like to at least get it looking a bit better, and more dynamic (hard code to hell and back right now).
